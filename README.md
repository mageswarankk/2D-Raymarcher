# 2D Raymarcher

A simple 2D drawable surface implementing real-time Raymarching lighting.

TODO:
- ~~Implement Jump flood algorithm for performance optimization.~~
- Fix stretching for non-square aspect ratios.
- Add UI to change brush settings (size, color, etc.)
- Add UI elements to tweak performance settings (ray count, ray length, etc.)
- (Eventually) Radiance Cascades!!!
